/*Abstraction means wrapping a data in a single unit with hiding backgrouud details
or else with hiding implemantation details

Ex : Car car company hiding internal component of car like engine, Spring,jumpers,etc.


Abstraction is achived by abstact keyword or interface
In abstraction we can able to declare method but we can not able to perform implemantation.
Implemantation is not allowd in abstraction.


we can not achive abstraction completly using abstract so for that we used interface.

Interface is also used for to make multiple inheritance or else multiple inheritance 
achived by Interface
